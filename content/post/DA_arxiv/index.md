title: ðŸŽ‰I've submitted our work on dynamical alignment to PRL!
summary: There is an unruly amount of u and b alignment in the 10k simulations, which I think is strongly related to the dynamo saturation. We have submitted direct tests the dynamical alignment theory to PRL, showing that alignment is even more wide-spread than dynamical alignment would predict.
