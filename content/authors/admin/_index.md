      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
My name is James Beattie and I'm interested magnetized turbulence and dynamo processes across multiple scales in the Universe, from Earth's magnetosheath and the interstellar medium, to the intracluster medium and the plasma environments around compact objects. I graduated my PhD in Jan. 2024, and am currently a postdoctoral research associate and fellow at Princeton University and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.

<!-- This includes steady state turbulence in a continuously driven state, where models such as dynamical alignment and critical balance may be relevant, to time dependent turbulent systems like fluctuation dynamos which are described with Kazantsev theory and decaying turbulence which are described in the language of rugged invariants (and invariants in general, e.g., the Hosking invariant). I like to apply these ideas to many types of astrophysical plasmas, and most recently, to merging neutron star systems, where Kelvin Helmholtz instabilities excite a diffusion-free-type dynamo that is able to grow the magnetic field by orders of magnitude within millisecond, which is potentially important for the Blandford–Znajek process. -->
