    abstract = "{The probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density contrast, s = ln (ρ/ρ0), with gas density ρ and mean density ρ0, for hydrodynamical supersonic turbulence is well-known to have significant non-Gaussian (intermittent) features that monotonically increase with the turbulent Mach number, \\$\\operatorname\\{\\mathcal \\{M\\}\\}\\$. By studying the mass- and volume-weighted s-PDF for an ensemble of 36 sub-to-trans-Alfv́enic mean-field, supersonic, isothermal turbulence simulations with different modes of driving, relevant to molecular gas in the cool interstellar medium, we show that a more intricate picture emerges for the non-Gaussian nature of s. Using four independent measures of the non-Gaussian components, we find hydrodynamical-like structure in the highly magnetised plasma for \\$\\mathcal \\{M\\} \\lesssim 4\\$. However, for \\$\\mathcal \\{M\\} \\gtrsim 4\\$, the non-Gaussian signatures disappear, leaving approximately Gaussian s-statistics – exactly the opposite of hydrodynamical turbulence in the high-\\$\\mathcal \\{M\\}\\$ limit. We also find that the non-Gaussian components of the PDF increase monotonically with more compressive driving modes. To understand the \\$\\mathcal \\{M\\} \\lesssim 4\\$ non-Gaussian features we use one-dimensional (1D) pencil beams to explore the dynamics along and across the large-scale magnetic field, \\$\\operatorname\\{\\mathrm\\{\\{\\boldsymbol \\{\\mathit \\{B\\}\\}\\}\\}\_0\\}\\$. We discuss kinetic, density and magnetic field fluctuations from the pencil beams, and identify physical sources of non-Gaussian components to the PDF as single, strong shocks coupled to fast magnetosonic compressions that form along \\$\\operatorname\\{\\mathrm\\{\\{\\boldsymbol \\{\\mathit \\{B\\}\\}\\}\\}\_0\\}\\$. We discuss the Gaussianisation of the \\$\\mathcal \\{M\\} \\gtrsim 4\\$s-fields through the lens of two phenomenologies: the self-similarity of the s-field and homogenisation of the dynamical timescales between the over- and under-dense regions in the compressible gas.}",

    JOURNAL={Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences},      
    VOLUME={9},

    ABSTRACT={The interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies is magnetized and turbulent. Cosmic rays (CRs) propagate through it, and those with energies from ∼ GeV − TeV are likely subject to the streaming instability, whereby the wave damping processes balances excitation of resonant ionic Alfvén waves by the CRs, reaching an equilibrium in which the propagation speed of the CRs is very close to the local ion Alfvén velocity. The transport of streaming CRs is therefore sensitive to ionic Alfvén velocity fluctuations. In this paper we systematically study these fluctuations using a large ensemble of compressible MHD turbulence simulations. We show that for sub-Alfvénic turbulence, as applies for a strongly magnetized ISM, the ionic Alfvén velocity probability density function (PDF) is determined solely by the density fluctuations from shocked gas forming parallel to the magnetic field, and we develop analytical models for the ionic Alfvén velocity PDF up to second moments. For super-Alfvénic turbulence, magnetic and density fluctuations are correlated in complex ways, and these correlations as well as contributions from the magnetic fluctuations sets the ionic Alfvén velocity PDF. We discuss the implications of these findings for underlying “macroscopic” diffusion mechanisms in CRs undergoing the streaming instability, including modeling the macroscopic diffusion coefficient for the parallel transport in sub-Alfvénic plasmas. We also describe how, for highly-magnetized turbulent gas, the gas density PDF, and hence column density PDF, can be used to access information about ionic Alfvén velocity structure from observations of the magnetized ISM.}

        abstract = {Forest ecosystems sequester approximately half of the world?s organic carbon (C), most of it in the soil. The amount of soil C stored depends on the input and decomposition rate of soil organic matter (OM), which is controlled by the abundance and composition of the microbial and invertebrate communities, soil physico-chemical properties, and (micro)-climatic conditions. Although many studies have assessed how these site-specific climatic and soil properties affect the decomposition of fresh OM, differences in the type and quality of the OM substrate used, make it difficult to compare and extrapolate results across larger scales. Here, we used standard wood stakes made from aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) to explore how climate and abiotic soil properties affect wood decomposition across 44 unharvested forest stands located across the northern hemisphere. Stakes were placed in three locations: (i) on top of the surface organic horizons (surface), (ii) at the interface between the surface organic horizons and mineral soil (interface), and (iii) into the mineral soil (mineral). Decomposition rates of both wood species was greatest for mineral stakes and lowest for stakes placed on the surface organic horizons, but aspen stakes decomposed faster than pine stakes. Our models explained 44 and 36\% of the total variation in decomposition for aspen surface and interface stakes, but only 0.1\% (surface), 12\% (interface), 7\% (mineral) for pine, and 7\% for mineral aspen stakes. Generally, air temperature was positively, precipitation negatively related to wood stake decomposition. Climatic variables were stronger predictors of decomposition than soil properties (surface C:nitrogen ratio, mineral C concentration, and pH), regardless of stake location or wood species. However, climate-only models failed in explaining wood decomposition, pointing toward the importance of including local-site properties when predicting wood decomposition. The difficulties we had in explaining the variability in wood decomposition, especially for pine and mineral soil stakes, highlight the need to continue assessing drivers of decomposition across large global scales to better understand and estimate surface and belowground C cycling, and understand the drivers and mechanisms that affect C pools, CO2 emissions, and nutrient cycles.},

    abstract = {Network capacity and reliability for free space optical communication (FSOC) is strongly driven by ground station availability, which is dominated by local cloud cover causing an outage. Here, we combine remote sensing data and novel methods to provide a generalized framework for assessing and optimizing optical ground station networks. This work is guided by an example network of eight Australian and New Zealand optical communication ground stations that span approximately 60\&\#x00B0; in longitude and 20\&\#x00B0; in latitude. Utilizing time-dependent cloud cover data from five satellites, we present a detailed analysis that determines the network availability and diversity, which showed that the Australasian region is well-suited for an optical network with a 69\% average site availability and low spatial cloud cover correlations. Employing methods from computational neuroscience, we provide a Monte Carlo method for sampling the joint probability distribution of site availabilities for an arbitrarily sized and point-wise correlated network of ground stations. Furthermore, we develop a general heuristic for site selection under availability and correlation optimizations and combine it with orbital propagation simulations to compare the data capacity between optimized networks and the example network. We show that the example network may be capable of providing tens of terabits per day to a low Earth orbit satellite and up to 99.97\% reliability to geostationary satellites. We therefore used the Australasian region to demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, novel, generalized tools for assessing and optimizing FSOC ground station networks, as well as the suitability of the region for hosting such a network.}
