abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but most established SSD theories have only considered incompressible flows. To address this gap, we perform viscoresistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ( M ), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ( Re ), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ( Pm ), focusing on the exponential growth phase. From these simulations, we develop robust measurements of the kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ( ℓν  and  ℓη , respectively), and show that  ℓν/ℓη∼Pm1/2  is a universal feature of turbulent ( Re≥Recrit≈100 ),  Pm≥1  SSDs, regardless of  M . We also measure the scale of maximum magnetic field strength ( ℓp ), where we confirm that incompressible SSDs (where either  M≤1  or  Re<Recrit ) concentrate magnetic energy at  ℓp∼ℓη  with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. By contrast, for compressible SSDs (where  M>1  and Re≥Recrit ), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large, overdense, coherent structures with ℓp∼(ℓturb/ℓshock)1/3ℓη≫ℓη , where  ℓshock  is the characteristic shock width, and  ℓturb  is the outer scale of the turbulent field. When  Pm<Re2/3 , the shift of  ℓp  (from the incompressible to compressible flow regime) is large enough to move the peak magnetic energy scale out of the subviscous range, and the plasma converges on a hierarchy of scales --  ℓturb>ℓp>ℓshock>ℓν>ℓη . In the compressible flow regime, more broadly, we also find that magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of the field strength, not because the field geometry has changed, but instead the field becomes locally amplified through flux-frozen compression by shocks. These results have implications for various astrophysical plasma environments in the early Universe, and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.
